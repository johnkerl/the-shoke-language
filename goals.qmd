Shókë is a thought experiment to explicitly reconstruct language evolution following Guy Deutscher's
_The Unfolding of Language_ (occasionally referred to herein as _TUoL_). Another closely followed
resource is David J. Peterson's _The Art of Language Invention_ (TAoLI).

The Old Shókë language is minimal, with a small paleolithic lexicon of nouns, verbs, and pointing
words -- onomatopoeic when possible.  Syntax is unsophisticated isolating SOV.

The Middle Shókë and New Shókë languages are artificial milestone-markings along the gradual path of
change of the language over time, from (mild) agglutination to (mild) fusion.

The lexicon is minimal -- no attempt is made to make even a vocabulary which would get a person
through even the most routine of days.

While I want to explore agglutination and fusion along with the formation of more complex grammar
over time, in a strongly non-English/non-head-initial context, I want to (perhaps unrealistically
so) avoid "complex" grammar, e.g. what distinguishes Russian or Turkish from Bahasa Indonesia.
There will be TMA markers for verbs but at no point do I intend to introduce words ten syllables
long, or verb systems fully inflected for number, person, gender, tense, and so on.
