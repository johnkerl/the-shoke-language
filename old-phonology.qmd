## Sound system

Consonants:

|            | Labial    | Dental      | Palato-alveolar | Velar    |
-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Oral Stop  |           |  _t_, _d_   |                 |_k_, _g_  |
| Fricative  |           |  _th_, _dh_ | _sh_, _zh_      | _x_      |
| Affricate  |           |             | _ch_, _j_       |          |
| Nasal Stop |  _m_, _n_ |             |                 |          |

The _t_ and _d_ are purely dental, as in Spanish.

I personally dislike _f_ and _v: their omission is plausible.  The omission of _p_ and _b_ is
implausible.

Vowels:

|            | Front     | Central     | Back    |
-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Close      | _i_       |             | _u_     |
| Mid        | _e_       |             | _o_     |
|            | _æ_       |             |         |
| Open       | _a_       |             |         |
| Liquid     | _r_       | _l_         |         |

It is to be noted that in Old Shókë, the liquids _r_ and _l_ are not consonants.  They function
exclusively as nuclei in onset-nucleus-coda structures (below).  For example, to pronounce _mrm_,
simply utter the English word _murmur_ but leave off the final _ur_.

To do: Few of these sounds are non-English. A bit more could be done in this direction.

## Phonotactics

Syllables are primarily CVC, and secondarily CV or CVCVC.

To do: formulate other restrictions as they arise.

## Stress

Stress is always on the penultimate syllable. In the title of this document we write _Shókë_ for
maximum clarity to the first-time reader; for internals of this document we will simply
write _shoke_.
