title: Plan

* The sound system is a little different than English; it could be moreso. While I want the syntax
to be very different from English (strongly head-final, with ergative-absolutive split), I don't
want the sound system to be _maximally_ different from English -- but I could go a little farther.
* Strict CVC, with a few CV exceptions, feels artificially simplistic
* Flesh out Old Shókë lexicon
* Iterate on Old Shókë example sentences, with low to medium syntactic complexity
* Then develop Middle Shókë
* Then develop New Shókë
* Maybe develop one or more cousin languages which split off from Shókë at some point in time
