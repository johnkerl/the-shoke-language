title: Syntax of Old Shókë

## Word order

Shókë is strongly head-final. In particular, word order is SOV.

The negative _che_ and the interrogative _dæ_ normally immediately precede the verb. However, they
can alternatively start the utterance. For example, if one were to make it clear that the listener
is going to be getting a question, or a _no_, one might start off saying _Che_ ...  or _Dæ_ ... to
set the tone, while going on to search for the right words to say.

To do: elaborate on.  Simple SOV, and then ... .
