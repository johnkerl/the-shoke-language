title: Transcription of Old Shókë
---

This document uses the Roman alphabet exclusively in place of IPA, with the exception of _æ_.  This
is to avoid the reader misinterpreting _ae_ as a dipthong.

The spelling _ch_ is pronounced as in English _church_; the spelling _x_ is as in Scottish _loch_.

Nothing is silent, including word-final _e_.

In example utterances, sentences will start with a capital letter; questions will be marked with a
_?_, and exclamations will be marked with a _!_.
